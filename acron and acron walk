# Acorn & Acorn-Walk Guide

## 📦 Installation
Before you start using `acorn` and `acorn-walk`, install them with **npm**:

```
npm install acorn acorn-walk
```

---

## 1. What is `acorn`?
* `acorn` is a **JavaScript parser**.
* A parser is like a **translator** that reads your JavaScript code and turns it into a structured format called an **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**.

Think of it like this:  
You write:
```
let x = 10;
```
* The computer doesn’t understand it directly.  
* `acorn` changes it into a **tree-like structure** that shows:
  * There is a variable declaration
  * Its name is `x`
  * Its value is `10`.

---

## 2. How does parsing happen?
Parsing has **two main steps**:

### (a) Tokenizing (Lexical Analysis)
* The code is broken into **tokens** (smallest meaningful pieces).  

Example:
```
let x = 10;
```
Becomes:
- `let` (keyword)  
- `x` (identifier)  
- `=` (operator)  
- `10` (number)  
- `;` (punctuation)  

So, tokenizing is like splitting a sentence into words.

---

### (b) Building the Tree (Syntax Analysis)
* After tokenizing, `acorn` arranges tokens into a **tree structure**.  
* This tree shows the **relationship** between tokens.

Example Tree for `let x = 10;` (simplified):
```
VariableDeclaration
 └── VariableDeclarator
      ├── Identifier (x)
      └── Literal (10)
```
This tree is the **AST**.

---

## 3. Why do we need AST?
* Tools like **Babel**, **ESLint**, and **Webpack** use this tree.  
* They read the AST to:
  - Check errors  
  - Transform code (e.g., ES6 → ES5)  
  - Optimize performance  

So `acorn` is the "front door" to understand JavaScript code for these tools.

---

## 4. Example with Acorn
Run this in Node.js:
```
const acorn = require("acorn");

const code = "let x = 10;";
const ast = acorn.parse(code, { ecmaVersion: 2020 });

console.log(ast);
```

### Output:
```
{
  "type": "Program",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "VariableDeclaration",
      "kind": "let",
      "declarations": [
        {
          "type": "VariableDeclarator",
          "id": { "type": "Identifier", "name": "x" },
          "init": { "type": "Literal", "value": 10 }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
That’s the AST — a structured way of saying:  
**“this program declares a variable `x` with value 10.”**

# 🌳 Acorn-Walk

## 1. What is `acorn-walk`?
* When **Acorn** parses your code, it gives you an **AST** (a big tree).  
* But just *having* the tree is not useful until you can **walk through it**.  
* `acorn-walk` helps you **visit each node** in that tree.

Think of it like this:
- Acorn builds a **family tree** 📜.  
- `acorn-walk` is the **person who walks through each family member** and says:  
  “This is the parent → here’s the child → here’s the grandchild.”

---

## 2. Why do we need it?
If you want to:
* Find **all function declarations** in code  
* Count **how many variables are declared**  
* Detect **which identifiers are used**  

—you don’t want to manually dig through the tree yourself.  

Instead, you let `acorn-walk` **walk node-by-node**, and you just write what to do when you visit each type of node.

---

## 3. Example
```
const acorn = require("acorn");
const walk = require("acorn-walk");

const code = "let x = 10; function hello() { return x; }";
const ast = acorn.parse(code, { ecmaVersion: 2020 });

// Walk through the AST
walk.simple(ast, {
  VariableDeclaration(node) {
    console.log("Found a variable declaration:", node.declarations.id.name);
  },
  FunctionDeclaration(node) {
    console.log("Found a function:", node.id.name);
  }
});
```

### Output:
```
Found a variable declaration: x
Found a function: hello
```

---

## 4. How `acorn-walk` works
It has different walking methods:

* **`walk.simple(ast, visitors)`**  
  → You give it the AST and an object of node types you care about.  
  → It will automatically walk through children nodes for you.

* **`walk.full(ast, callback)`**  
  → Calls your callback on **every single node**, no matter the type.

* **`walk.recursive(ast, visitors, base)`**  
  → Lets you control how the walk happens (**advanced**).

---

## 5. Real-life Analogy
Imagine your **school**:
- Each classroom = a node in the tree  
- The whole school = the AST  
- `acorn` builds the school map 🏫  
- `acorn-walk` is like the **class monitor** walking into each class and checking:  
  * Who is the teacher?  
  * Who are the students?  
  * Is someone missing?  

👉 You just tell the monitor what to check, and they do the walking for you.

Perfect! Here’s your content restructured into a **developer-friendly `README.md`** for the `glob` npm package:  

````markdown
# 🌍 Glob Guide for Node.js

## 📦 Installation
Install `glob` from npm:

```
npm install glob
```

---

## 🔹 What is `glob`?
The **`glob`** package is a popular Node.js library used to **match files and directories** using patterns, similar to how shell commands work.  

Patterns use wildcards like `*`, `?`, and `**` to match filenames flexibly.

### Examples
- `*.js` → Matches all `.js` files in the current folder.  
- `**/*.js` → Matches all `.js` files in the current folder and **recursively** in all subfolders.  
- `src/**/*.ts` → Matches all `.ts` files inside the `src` directory, recursively.

---

## 🔹 Usage

### Example: Find all JavaScript files recursively
```
const glob = require("glob");

// Find all JavaScript files recursively
glob("**/*.js", (err, files) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error:", err);
    return;
  }
  console.log("Matched files:", files);
});
```

---

## 🔹 Features
- ✅ Supports **shell-style patterns** (`*`, `?`, `{}`)  
- ✅ Can search **recursively** with `**`  
- ✅ Works with both **callbacks** and **Promises** (when using [`glob-promise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-promise))  
- ✅ Supports **ignoring files/folders**  

---

## 🔹 Example with Ignore
```
const glob = require("glob");

glob("**/*.js", { ignore: "node_modules/**" }, (err, files) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(files);
});
```

👉 This finds all `.js` files **except** those inside the `node_modules` folder.

---

## 🔹 Real-World Use Cases
You’ll often see `glob` in **build tools, test runners, and scripts** where file matching is required.  

Some common use cases:
- 📂 Finding all **source files** for a build process  
- ✅ Filtering files before **running tests**  
- 🧹 Cleaning up files (like `*.log`) in a project  
- ⚡ Dynamically importing files (e.g., routes in an **Express app**)  

---

## 🔹 Related Tools
- **`glob-promise`** → Promise-based wrapper for `glob`  
- **fast-glob** → A faster and more modern alternative to `glob`  

---

## 🎯 Summary
The **`glob`** package makes it super easy to select files and directories in Node.js projects using simple patterns.  
It’s widely used in tools like **eslint**, **webpack**, and **mocha** for file discovery.
